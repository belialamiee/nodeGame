playing around with node



This is a simple little shooter with naming/chat functionality. Uses Socket.io and a node server.

This requires node.js to be installed on the server.

Then navigate to the folder where you have cloned this repo and start via node app.js


I have provided a sample service for Ubuntu 16.04.
