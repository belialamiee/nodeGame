playing around with node



This is a simple little shooter with naming/chat functionality. Uses Socket.io and a node server.

This requires node.js to be installed on the server.

Then navigate to the folder where you have cloned this repo and start via node app.js

TODO separate concerns, the chat functionality needs to be a separate application 

I have provided a sample service for Ubuntu 16.04.
